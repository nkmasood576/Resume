Business Intelligence Consultant with over 6 years of experience in designing and delivering end-to-end data solutions across finance, supply chain, and planning domains. Skilled in building enterprise-grade dashboards using Power BI, migrating legacy pipelines from Azure Synapse to Microsoft Fabric, and developing robust semantic models and T-SQL procedures for SAP data sources.

My core strengths include financial reporting (P&L, Balance Sheet, payroll), advanced SQL scripting, DAX modeling, and data validation frameworks. Iâ€™ve led projects involving fiscal year variant integration, data reconciliation, and planning automation using Jedox.

Passionate about turning complex datasets into actionable insights, I thrive in cross-functional environments where data accuracy, performance, and stakeholder alignment are key to success.
